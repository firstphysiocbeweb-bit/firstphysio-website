## 🏛️ 3. Website Architecture
We have developed a comprehensive 17+ page structure to establish clinical authority:

### ⭐ Highlight Feature: Interactive Body Diagram
We implemented a custom **"Where Does It Hurt?"** interactive anatomy explorer. This feature allows patients to visually identify their pain points on a 3D-styled model, which then guides them to the relevant physiotherapy treatment pages.

## 🛡️ 6. Security & Maintenance

*   **Custom 404:** A professional "Page Not Found" guide to keep visitors on the site if they make a typo.
*   **Mobile-First Design:** The site is fully responsive, looking premium on iPhones, Android devices, and Tablets.
